## A Wonderful skills assessment

From this point, you will have 2 hours to code and **package** your solution to the following assessment:


First, download this repository. The folder `skills-assessment` contains one simple HTML page. Your goal is to migrate it to AEM and make the content authorable. Please do the assessment according to industry best practices as you would in real conditions. You will be asked to explain any places where your solution does not match our expectations.

**Bonus points**: Work on 6.3. Don't use Sightly slightly. Have fun with Global Properties. Avoid classic UI.
