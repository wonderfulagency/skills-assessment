## A Wonderful skills assessment

From this point on, you will have 2 hours to code, package and deliver your solution:


First, download this repository. The folder `skills-assessment` contains one simple HTML page. For this exercise you will convert this static webpage page into an authorable AEM 6.1 page, preferably into your local environment. You will be expected to demonstrate knowledge of best practices not only for AEM but for HTML and CSS. Upon completing the migration of the page into AEM you will move on to the second part of the interview where you will talk with our Technical Director about your approach and the final result.

**Bonus points**:  
Make the site authorable on 6.3  
Use Sightly  
Show off your use of Global Properties  
Avoid classic UI  
Add some fancy JavaScript  
Finish under the time limit  
Consider Mobile
